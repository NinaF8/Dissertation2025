# Dissertation2025
This is the code repository for my 2025 Dissertation in English Language and Literature. Included is experiment scripts in jsPsych, data analysis in R, and visualizations. The project investigates how users adjust syntactic structures when interacting with human vs. AI interlocutors.

The JsPsychExperiment contains all the code used to construct the experiment. If you are interested in playing the experiment yourself, you can follow these links:

AI confederate partner: https://ninabechis.ppls.ed.ac.uk/Dissertation/acexp.html 

Human confederate partner: https://ninabechis.ppls.ed.ac.uk/Dissertation/hiexp.html

The code used to synthesise the results can be found under RStudioResultsCode, with Manuscript.html being the raw code, and Dissertation.pdf being the finalized version. 

The the participant results produced by the experiment and used synthesised in R are not available for privacy reasons.
